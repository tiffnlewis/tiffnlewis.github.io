				There are ways to be unique, stand out. At one point in my life, these would have been techniques I would struggle to maintain, master or even come remotely close to mimicking. Then, I had an epiphany a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away (also known as self-discovery in your twenties). I am comfortable being myself. A true existential crisis, you can imagine.  
			</p>

				So, here I am now. My hobbies are my life and I love them tremendously. I bake to the extent of buying ingredients in bulk. I knit to the extreme of needing a yarn closet just to hold my excess of "maybe one day" skeins. I quilt with the hopes my daughter will just as my grandmother did. I garden just so I know when I'm canning preserves, how much love was given to each vegetable and fruit in the process. I play the flute because everyone wants to know a flute player who can bang out some Dylan tunes, right?

				So, little house on the prairie over here all the time. And that's my spare time. There is so much more! Professionally. Yes, let's move into that. I went to college for creative writing. Yes, you read that right. Who does that? Children of starry-eyed GenXers. That's who.

				I was lucky enough to be given an opportunity to work for a non-profit in insurance regulation. In an assistant role to the Center for Insurance Policy and Research and Actuarial Services at the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, I was able to discover and develop a myriad of skills. Beyond daily administrative tasks for a staff that supported over 40 committees and subcommittees, I jumped into up and coming topics that would potentially affect the insurance industry. Sounds riveting, right? Wait for it. Some of these things that may spark a reader's interest are autonomous vehicles, medical and recreational marijuana, bitcoin and blockchain, drones, and the affordable care act.

			<p>
				Because of this amazing company, I was introduced to web development on an administrative daily maintenance level and predictive data analytics on a executive and regulatory level.
